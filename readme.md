# xd-plugin-cloud-shared-artifacts

This is a super quick, day-one swipe at working with [the new `cloud` module](https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/reference/cloud.html#cloudgetsharedartifacts) introduced in XD 14. It's a simple demo, and not intended to be maintained.

The plugin also makes use of the [plugin toolkit](https://github.com/AdobeXD/plugin-toolkit) library for quick construction of the dialog.

## Usage

First, [package and install](https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/distribution/packaging.html) the plugin.

Once installed, to run the plugin, go to:

> _Plugins > See Cloud Shared Artifacts..._
